Make live satellite imagery your desktop background with SpaceEye.

Choose from 10 different live views of the Earth. See real-time weather patterns in high resolution as they occur. Watch shadows move throughout the day as the sun rises and sets.

SpaceEye gets current images from geostationary weather satellites and sets them as your desktop background, updating (at most) every 20 minutes.

Includes live views from the satellites Himawari-8, GOES-17 (West), and GOES-16 (East).

FREE AND OPEN SOURCE

SpaceEye is provided free of charge and the source code is available to everyone. Contributions are welcome!

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Special thanks to NOAA and Colorado State University for providing the satellite imagery.
